1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,920
[Silence]

2
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:38,780
READY. READY. In the end, Charlie's mango entremets sent
him home. Spakers remain as they compete for the coveted

3
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:52,920
Great Chocolate Showdown title. This is not good. Just
start again. We are the last six Spakers. I cannot believe I

4
00:00:52,920 --> 00:01:03,900
even made it this far and I am so excited. Hello, bakers! Hi!
Each of you has made incredible strides on your path to

5
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:13,720
becoming better bakers. But we're here to sweeten your
skills. It's time for your next technique test. Bakers, in

6
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:21,840
today's technique test, I'm going to show you how to make a
staple in the dessert world. The meringue. Oh, okay. There

7
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,940
are many delectable ways to marry chocolate and meringue.
I'm going to show you Italian meringue because it's the most

8
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:36,220
stable. Here's a tip for you bakers. Room temperature egg
whites whip up much better than cold ones. I'm adding some

9
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:42,240
cream of tartar which will help stabilize the meringue and
gives it a flexible, bouncy texture. Now I'm going to start

10
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,940
whipping my egg whites at a lower speed. Whipping at a lower
speed helps for air bubbles which will make the meringue

11
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:55,560
more stable. I want to get my egg whites to soft peak before I
add my sugar syrup, which I need to get to a temperature of 240

12
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,320
degrees Fahrenheit. Once it's up to temperature, I have to
slowly pour it into my sugar syrup. So now I'm going to show

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:10,699
you how to add color to your meringue. I'm using liquid food
gel color because it's highly concentrated. Chef Cynthia

14
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:16,980
looks so elegant while she shows us how to make meringues.
But there is no way that I'm going to look like Chef Cynthia.

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm going to look at how it makes most likely. And now comes
the best part, piping it. First, throws. Next, a two-tone

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,580
star drop. Now this may look like a plain white meringue, but
looks can be deceiving because I've painted the inside of

17
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:39,020
the piping tip with food coloring. And this is going to
create a striped effect. Now you can pipe meringue directly

18
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:45,540
onto your parchment paper or you can also pipe it onto
skewers which will give height to your dessert. I'm piping

19
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:52,240
onto the dull end of my skewer so that the pointy end can be
inserted easily into a cake or a showpiece. Now that my

20
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:58,460
meringue is piped, I'm ready to bake it. And I bake my
meringues at 250 degrees Fahrenheit. Familiar with is

21
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:04,580
lemon meringue pie that my mom used to make. So I hope this is
something that I could do. My meringues are out of the oven

22
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:10,900
and cooled. Now it's time to decorate. I've painted my cone
form with white chocolate and I have some tempered

23
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,300
chocolate here to attach my meringue to my structure. Once
I've added all my meringues, I'll have something that looks

24
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:28,920
like this. Wow. Beautiful. For your next technique test,
you must create a themed meringue tower and six mini

25
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:39,780
desserts featuring meringue and chocolate. Oh, Christmas
tree. The piping possibilities and color choices are

26
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:48,260
endless. So we want to see a multi-colored and
multi-textured masterpiece. We expect amazing meringue

27
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:58,680
towers. So we're giving you a little extra baking power.
You're working in pairs. In order to find out who you'll be

28
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:13,680
working with, please choose the chocolate bar. Emma,
you're up first. Purple. Teal. Purple. I am so happy that me

29
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,899
and Emma are a pair because she decorates amazing and I have
the flavors. So this would be a great duo. Kristin, you're

30
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:33,000
next. I have pink. Mike. I chose teal. This is great. Tim and I
are going to make a really strong team. That means, Allie,

31
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,420
you'll be working with Kristin. I agree. Allie's precision
and Mike create eight of skills. That's going to make a great

32
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:49,340
team. Baker's Sweet Safety is in a table. From this point on,
all of you will bake in the Chocolate Elimination

33
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:56,800
Challenge. And the winning team of this technique test will
receive a special advantage in the Next Elimination

34
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:05,400
Challenge. The pantry is fully stocked with the finest
chocolate and ingredients. And you'll have two hours and 45

35
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:20,000
minutes to complete this test. Ready? Steady? Get your
sweet on. What should we call our theme? Pastel Princess

36
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:27,960
Dream. Ashley and I decide to do a pastel princess dream
theme because we love the colors of pastel and they match our

37
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,980
shirts. It's going to be cool. We got this. Our theme is the
rainbow candy shop. It looks so pretty. Kristin and I decide

38
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:44,700
to make a rainbow candy shop meringue tower because we love
rainbow colors. We got this. We do got this. Okay, I said we

39
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:51,800
make a peach themed cone and then a peach themed dessert so
it's really cohesive. Our theme is Life's a Peach because

40
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,460
Tim currently lives in Atlanta and I used to live in Atlanta
and Atlanta and the state of Georgia. Let's go. Let's go. We

41
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:07,500
got this. Merengues are so fun and they pair so well with
chocolate. And in terms of making a meringue that will hold

42
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,120
its shape, volume and color you need to be able to learn how to
read the meringue in the mixer. And you can tell when it's

43
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:22,280
whipped because it's glossy and shiny and holds a stiff
peak. Fast and smart. Fast and smart. So for this technique

44
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:28,660
test we're making six minute white chocolate peach décois
with a peach compote and a graham cracker and pecan crumble.

45
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:34,580
But the first thing that we start on is our meringue. As I
start my meringue I start by separating my egg whites and if

46
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:40,540
you get any yolk inside of these egg whites then it can throw
off the consistency of your meringue and it may not set.

47
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:50,620
How's it going over there? Good. I'm at 240 so you're such a
talented parer. I'm proud of you. For our mini desserts

48
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:59,980
we're going to make a chai spice macaron with a Swiss
meringue buttercream and a milk chocolate ganache. And we

49
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:06,800
are good. My meringue mixture is at the right peaks that it
needs to be. I'm feeling very good about this before. I'm

50
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,180
just going to whip a little bit more and then they'll be
ready. How's it going Ashley? You good? I'm good. Okay. For

51
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:19,240
our mini desserts we're making pavlovo filled with milk
chocolate pastry cream and fresh fruits. Watch your eggs.

52
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:25,080
You don't want to over whip. Oh yeah, yeah. We are both going
at such a fast pace and I'm really glad that we're on the same

53
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:34,200
page. All right I'm starting on another batch. Yeah me too.
Get those things whipped up. So silky. Now it's time to color

54
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,960
the meringues and I'm going to start off with pink. My
favorite color. Is this pink online? Love it. Are you happy

55
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:46,860
with your color over there? Alrighty. One of the pitfalls
our bakers can run into is in working in their color that

56
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:53,940
they're over folding. So with every fold you are deflating
that meringue a little bit and then if you fold too much when

57
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:00,340
those meringues hit the heat of the oven they'll start
breaking down and then they become too fragile and crumbly.

58
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:06,080
We're doing good. We're doing good. Okay I'm going to start
working on the peach color jab. Okay. I'm making sure that we

59
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,660
have a variation of color for our peach themed tower from a
deeper darker peachy red to almost a yellow tone. Yeah I like

60
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,840
that. Yeah right? I like it a lot. The goal is piping out
different shapes colors. Oh these are cool looking man.

61
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:25,880
Also you have meringue in your beard right now. I thought it
made me look distinguished. Trying not to be so messy but I

62
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,500
gotta speed it up. As I'm working on the larger meringues,
Allie is working on the smaller ones. Hey Allie how's your

63
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:38,280
piping going over there? Pretty good. I'm feeling really
good about these meringues. They are looking wonderful and

64
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:45,500
vibrant. It's going to be so good. Now all the teams have
their meringues in the oven so our bakers really don't need

65
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,540
to stop working on their desserts. I am starting on the
shells for our macaron. It's my first time actually popping

66
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:58,480
this. It's not to be too sloppy with them. I've never made
macarons before so I hope these come out right. Oh that looks

67
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,220
awesome. I'm going to go ahead and start on the peach
compote. Okay I'm going to start tempering chocolate.

68
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,020
Perfect. So now I'm moving on to tempering chocolate. This
tempered chocolate is going to be the glue that's going to

69
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:15,240
allow us to put our meringues onto this comb. Another
chocolate coming along. It is taking it sweet time. Alright

70
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:23,300
we got to get to hopefully decorating by a one hour mark. Yeah
this chocolate is taking forever to come to temper. Bakers

71
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,820
one hour left. I'm frustrated because if I can't get this
chocolate tempered enough time to put our tower together.

72
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:45,500
Come on. Can't make this cool any faster. I know I'm
tempering the chocolate correctly but I'm wondering if

73
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:50,180
maybe I'm making a little bit too much which is why it's
taking so long. So I take some of the white chocolate out and

74
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:55,680
put it into another bowl and that chocolate I'll use to cover
the comb. Okay this is ready to paint the comb if you want to

75
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,340
take it. Finally after what feels like forever our white
chocolate is being tempered. This tempered chocolate is

76
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:08,280
going to be the glue that's going to allow us to put our
meringues onto this comb. Yes sir. We got this. For this

77
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:17,940
technique test we have to mix six mini meringue desserts and
a meringue tower. My vision for the top of our tower is to make

78
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:28,640
a big pastel lollipop. Perfect for a princess. I finished
doing my meringues. My macarons are set. Now it's time to

79
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,940
coat the base of the tower. Looks really good Christian.
Thanks. Okay I am ready to start putting stuff on. Miss

80
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:43,780
tempered chocolate that took forever is working in peace to
the tower itself. Looks like a traffic cone. 30 minutes. We

81
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:51,240
got everything done we just got a symbol. Yes. Just do it.
Just to get them all make them look good. Life's a peach.

82
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:59,780
Life's a peach. Bakers 15 minutes left on the clock. Alright
y'all keep going. Keep on hustling. At this point I'm

83
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:11,540
sticking them anywhere. Oh because the malls are good. It's
getting there. You got this. Come on baking. Oh my freaking

84
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:30,240
gosh. 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 time's up. Did that girl. Yeah.
I'm really looking forward to the judges tasting this

85
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,780
dessert and know the flavors there and I know they're going
to be wowed by it. Oh my god how bad you know. It looks pretty

86
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:45,500
good. Snaps for the rainbow candy shop. Bakers in teams of
two we asked you to create a themed meringue tower and six

87
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:57,980
mini meringue based desserts. Christian, Allie. Yeah.
Allie and I created a rainbow candy shop thing meringue

88
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:07,480
tower with a chai spice macaron and a Swiss meringue
buttercream and a milk chocolate ganache. Well this is a

89
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:16,120
kaleidoscope of color and texture. You've done some
fantastic piping work. Your meringues are well executed

90
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:25,980
but I wish you hadn't have gone for the luster spray because
my favorite color scheme on this tower is this patch get two

91
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:33,220
with the luster spray. Look at that vibrance and then over
here where the blueish luster spray got to it, it mutes all

92
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:53,060
the colors. They look perfect. Allie, Kristen, I love your
macaron for the first time ever making it. Get over here.

93
00:12:53,060 --> 00:13:01,260
Chefs practice their whole life and they can't get it. Thank
you. Your milk chocolate ganache melts in my mouth at that

94
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:08,600
punch of chocolate. Your chai Swiss buttercream it balance
so well with your chocolate ganache. Nice work. I'm so proud

95
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:22,780
of you. I am so stoked. Go Allie, go Kristen. Mike, Tim,
please bring us your meringue tower. Our meringue tower is

96
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:30,880
named Life's A Peach. We made a white chocolate peach de
quoi. There is a peach compote and a graham cracker pecan

97
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:39,620
crumble. Well, I really like that you did a lot of unique
different piping techniques, different color schemes,

98
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:47,940
but your desserts, they look roughly assembled and your
meringue shells. A daquoise is a meringue that has ground

99
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:54,380
nuts stirred into it and then baked and then that is layered
with your creams and your fillings. So did you stir any nuts

100
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:09,960
into that meringue? No, we did not. Shall we give it a taste?
Yes. Mike, Tim, I can certainly see the nod to peaches, but I

101
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:17,440
can see some of your swirls have started to collapse on each
other and that's just because some of the volume from your

102
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:25,860
meringue was lost. Chocolate work. If you go to that much
work to make a leaf like that, I want to see more. But when it

103
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:34,000
comes down to the desserts, the flavor of the peaches with
the graham and the pecans and the cinnamon, it just has that

104
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:43,440
wonderful comfort food feel, but had it been presented as an
elegant dessert, would have blown my mind. Thank you. Thank

105
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,820
you. I'm most nervous about the judges' critique about the
appearance, but they absolutely love the way the dessert

106
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:58,340
tastes, so I hope that's going to make up for it. Emma and
Ashley, you're up. Our theme of this meringue tower is

107
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:08,400
pastel princess dream. And we made six peplovers with milk
chocolate, pastry cream and fresh fruit. Ashley and Emma,

108
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:17,900
wow, this truly is a meringue tower fit for a princess. And of
course, you were very smart and painted your cone along the

109
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:25,600
same tones, which helps unify the look. I love that you added
a top things the whole thing together. Okay, shall we give

110
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:39,640
these a try? Yeah, please. Your milk chocolate pastry cream
was on point. It wasn't overly sweet, which was good because

111
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:47,160
with the meringue being sweet, it would have been too
intense, but your desserts are inconsistent, so you got to

112
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:55,560
make sure every single one is the same. I have to flag one
concern of mine. Your dessert is prepared from the exact

113
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:04,540
same meringue that you used to create the tower. A meringue
and a pavlova is intended to be crispy all the way through. A

114
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:09,440
pavlova should be crunchy on the outside, soft in the
center, and two ingredients are added to the meringue,

115
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:21,920
cornstarch and lemon juice. This is actually a meringue
nest. Thank you. Thank you. BAKERS, congratulations. All

116
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:30,700
of you delivered delightful and playful showpieces. But
there was one team who created a meringue tower that was a

117
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:48,780
vibrant, multi-textured masterpiece. Alongs two.
BAKERS, there was one team who created a meringue tower that

118
00:16:48,780 --> 00:17:02,540
was a multi-textured masterpiece. And that tower belongs
to... Kristen and Allie. Thank you. Your rainbow candy shop

119
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:10,859
was a technicolor triumph. And that macaron at the end of the
rainbow was a tasty little treasure. A special advantage in

120
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:23,280
the next challenge. Mmm, yeah. BAKERS, all of you have come a
long way in the skills you've shown us. And you've also come a

121
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:37,020
long way to be here in this kitchen. We know you must miss
home. So we have a postcard from someone who misses you too.

122
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:48,280
Oh, my daughter! It's from my mom. It's from my sister, my
husband and my third son, Clay. It's from my grandmother.

123
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:55,740
And she says, Hi, Kristen. I'm sitting here thinking about
you and how much I miss you. I love you so much and so proud of

124
00:17:55,740 --> 00:18:01,280
you. My daughter, Janayia, says congratulations, mommy,
on making it this far. Hang in there, you're making me so

125
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:10,920
proud. Your hard work does not go unnoticed. Never give up.
Words cannot express how proud I am of you. I know that Dad and

126
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:19,380
Patrick are cheering you on from above. You are a rising
star, something so important and being visible for

127
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:26,840
Indigenous women. I love you so much and so proud of you. I
know you can do it. Dear Daddy, we miss you and care for you. We

128
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:34,720
are cheering for you to win $50,000. I miss you so much and I'm
rooting you on. Your biggest cheerleader, love mom. Love

129
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:48,700
Janayia. Love grandmother. I'm good. I love you from Clay.
He's an amazing kid. He's very unique. I don't even know the

130
00:18:48,700 --> 00:19:00,400
last time I cried. We have a bunch of softies in here. We hope
your postcards provide a bit of comfort and some sweet

131
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:08,820
motivation for your next bake. Desserts have the power to
take us on amazing journeys from a trip back home to a faraway

132
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:14,540
place we've only dreamed about. For your next chocolate
elimination challenge, you are going on a flavorful

133
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:21,980
adventure. We want you to create a plated chocolate dessert
highlighting an ingredient from our international

134
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:30,460
pantry. Okay. On your postcards, you will find a number that
matches a number on the cupboard. Who's got number one?

135
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:48,340
That'd be me. Tip. Blue corn. Kristen. I have wattle seed.
Mike. I have add Zuki Beans. Number four. I got Sumac. Number

136
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:59,900
five. Black Sesame Paste. Last but not least, Ashley. I got
Tiger Nuts. Kristin and Allie, ask the winners of the

137
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:10,680
technique test. You will each receive some judge advice
once during your bake. A ring of bell. And ask for one of us to

138
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:18,460
help you with some expert tips for success. The pantry is
fully stocked with the finest chocolate and ingredients,

139
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:23,780
and you'll have two and a half hours to complete this
challenge. The baker who presents us with our least

140
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:38,080
favorite dessert will be going home. Ready? Steady? Get
your chocolate on. Let's go. I think after receiving these

141
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,400
postcards, everyone wants to put their best foot forward.
Seem to be threatened. We're taking off with this

142
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:49,480
challenge. We don't want to just see the ingredients
sprinkled on top. We want to be able to taste those flavors.

143
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:56,800
So they need to play with the ingredient and discover does it
need to be steeped into a liquid? Does it need to be heated? So

144
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:05,120
they really have to step up their gate. Tiger Nuts originate
from North Africa and not actually nuts with small root

145
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:12,080
vegetables with a sweet nutty flavor similar to coconut. I
already know a little bit about Tiger Nuts. My best friend's

146
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:20,320
husband is from Africa and he makes Tiger Nut pudding. So I'm
making a Tiger Nut, and I'm going to substitute the almond

147
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,540
for the Tiger Nut. I'm going to have a chocolate Tiger Nut
base of vanilla custard, and I'm going to have chocolate on

148
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:33,980
the top. And I'm also making a Tiger Nut brittle. I put it in my
food processor to blend them. Not working. How long are they

149
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:41,560
chopping up? The Tiger Nuts are too hard. I have to boil these
nuts so I can blend them up. Or I'm just not going to be able to

150
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:47,620
give the judges anything. And I want to make my daughter
Janaya so proud of me. I boil my Tiger Nuts, take them out, and

151
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:55,800
I start to blend them. Finally. Azuki beans are commonly
used in East Asian desserts flavor. I am making a matcha and

152
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:03,300
azuki bean whipped cream roulade with a milk chocolate
ganache, matcha crumble, some azuki bean jellies, and a

153
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:09,500
dark chocolate sauce. I cannot use the azuki beans the way
that they are. No one wants to bite into a whole bean. So I'm

154
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,920
going to put them in the food processor and blend them down
really finely. And then I'm going to add some sugar to the

155
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:22,200
azuki bean paste and heat them together to bring out the
azuki bean flavor while also adding a lot of sweetness. Mmm.

156
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:27,900
That is much better with a lot of sugar in it. I know my dad and
my husband are cheering me on from above. So I'm going to give

157
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:35,060
it my best. Flavor with hints of coffee and hazelnut. I'm
making a wattle seed pina cotta and a chocolate hazelnut

158
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:42,720
shortbread with a chocolate wattle seed espresso sauce and
a caramelized hazelnut crumble. First, I'm going to get

159
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,820
started on my wattle seed pina cotta and I boil my wattle seed
with the cream and sugar so it can absorb the flavor. And I put

160
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:54,960
it in the fridge to set. Boop-boop-boop. Next, I put my
chocolate hazelnut wattle seed shortbread on a baking

161
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:03,360
tray. Oh, yeah. This is fine. Okay. I'm making a milk
chocolate black sesame mochi filled with black sesame milk

162
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:11,440
chocolate ganache with black sesame sablé and a strawberry
gelet. The black sesame flavor is really nutty and rich, so

163
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,240
the strawberries are going to bring a sweetness to it. I'm
making mochi because mochi is traditionally a Japanese

164
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,460
dessert and black sesame paste is also from Japan, so I think
the two pair well together. I think many people are familiar

165
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:32,380
with toasted sesame oil, but black sesame paste has an even
more pronounced sesame flavor, which means a nuttiness,

166
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:40,560
almost a smokiness. And I think the fact that Emma is using
milk chocolate will pair well with the sesame. I'm doing

167
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:48,140
donuts. Yum. I'm going to be making a blue corn chocolate
donut, but I'm going to elevate it with a rose water and

168
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:55,160
raspberry coulis, a cardamom, diplomat cream, and a blue
corn lace twill, and pistachio crumble. I'm going into this

169
00:23:55,160 --> 00:24:01,000
challenge after receiving this postcard more focused than
ever. It made me start thinking about not just Clay, but my

170
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:08,200
other two kids, my wife. I know they're all rooting for me.
Now it's time to bake. Sumac is a spice that has a citrus-like

171
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:15,960
quality and can also be used to add a pop of color to a dish. I am
making a milk chocolate vertical sumac tart. That's not

172
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:23,980
fancy. I am literally standing a tart up on its side. There's
no backing to it at all, and there's going to be sumac milk

173
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:29,800
chocolate ganache, a sumac caramel sauce, milk chocolate
mousse, and a white chocolate tempered garnish. And

174
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:38,120
hopefully the judges love that. Kristen and I got this
advantage, and it's a huge deal. If at any point we get stuck,

175
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:48,800
we can ring the bell and get help. We'll see how this goes.
Elise is my shortbread. Smells delicious. So now I'm going

176
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:55,280
to check on my Waddle Sea Pina Cotta. Doesn't look like it's
setting correctly. Oh, goodness. It's like half set at the

177
00:24:55,280 --> 00:25:12,820
bottom, but not so much at the top. This is not good. Bakers,
one hour left. Oh, goodness. I'm nervous that my panna cotta

178
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:21,400
is not going to be set in time, so I think I'm going to use this
bell for some advice. Chef Anna, I need your help. I'll be

179
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:29,420
right there. Kristen. Can we check my panna cotta? Yes,
please. Oh, your gelatin is not dissolved in it. So what

180
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:35,960
should I do? I think you're better off just start again.
Starting over? Yeah. Blune the gelatin, make sure it gets

181
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:43,500
fully melted in that cream. Mm-hmm. Put it in a flutter dish,
and then it'll chill faster. OK. I'm running out of time, but

182
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,820
when Chef Anna tells you to start something over, you do it.
On to the next step. For this chocolate elimination

183
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:56,600
challenge, we must have a plate of dessert that highlights
an ingredient from the international pantry. I'm going to

184
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:03,660
do the filling for my Nanaimo bar. I mix butter, powdered
sugar, vanilla, and heavy cream. Pale like yellow, I know

185
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:09,020
that it's already. There needs to whip because it needs to
change in color. At the same time, I'm making my tiger nut

186
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:18,200
brutal. Ooh, my glasses. Glasses keep fogging up. This is
going to be a great brutal. Ooh, it smells so good. My cake is

187
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:28,320
cooling, so I am going to incorporate my azuki bean paste
into a cream filling. I'm also going to make a jelly out of the

188
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:34,120
bean because it should also enhance the azuki bean flavor.
I'm also going to make a milk chocolate ganache to go with it

189
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:41,980
because the judges always like to see more chocolate. These
are my strawberry gelet, and they look pretty good to me. And

190
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:49,160
now it's time to make my mochi. To make the mochi, I mix
together fruit and rice flour, sugar, and water, and then

191
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:57,160
put that in the microwave and heat it up. The texture of mochi
is really sticky, and it kind of feels like modeling clay. I

192
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:04,160
flatten out the mochi dough and roll it in cornstarch and
make discs so that I can fill it with my black sesame ganache.

193
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:11,260
I think that they will be a good texture. Now that my tart
dough is ready to go and my ganache is made, it's time to get

194
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:19,080
started on my sumac caramel sauce. It does not look right.
Oh, no, it's crystallized. That's not good. At this point, I

195
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:25,760
decide to ring my bell to get some input from Chef Steve
because if I don't get this caramel sauce on my plate, I will

196
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:32,520
only have one element of sumac, and that is not good. I'm
really having problems with my caramel. Okay, was your

197
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,660
cream hot when you added it or cold? Room temp. Room
temperature. Quick trick. First, warm your cream and your

198
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:43,800
sumac together. Bring it to a boil. Strain it. Then, when you
get that golden amber color, you pour your cream into your

199
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:52,520
sugar slowly whisking. Once that's done, take it off. Allow
it to most fire buttery. Okay, thank you. Good luck. Okay, I

200
00:27:52,520 --> 00:28:00,040
can do this. I attempt to make my caramel sauce again, and
this is still not working. My caramel keeps crystallizing,

201
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:08,660
and crystallization in your caramel is a big no-no. So I'm
just gonna stick with my original batch. And even though it

202
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:17,560
doesn't look like caramel sauce, it still tastes great. You
have 30 minutes left! It's time for me to work on this blue

203
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:24,880
corn twill. Oh, okay. I see you're starting to do this little
thing thing. This is going to add a list occasion to this

204
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:34,580
plate. When you read the word, it looks like you're supposed
to go... Twills and twirls. Okay. I'm gonna attempt to roll

205
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:40,060
my cake. Before I roll the roulette, I need to make sure I, of
course, include the whipped cream that I've made that's got

206
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:45,600
the azuki bean in it, and then I also have my milk chocolate
ganache that needs to be spread as well. I'm nervous about

207
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,460
rolling this roulette, because the biggest danger when
making roulette is if the cake cracks. If it does, the

208
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,080
ingredients you put on the inside are gonna start seeping
out, and you're gonna lose that beautiful swirl effect that

209
00:28:55,080 --> 00:29:01,280
you've worked so hard for. Okay, I am happy with how that
looks. Please look perfect, please look perfect, please

210
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:11,160
look perfect. After I punch out the ganache, it's time to put
it in the tart shell. And the tart shell breaks. Oh, it is so

211
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:18,940
fragile. I only have two tart shells left. So I have to be
really careful, because I have no room for error. Oh, my

212
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:27,220
gosh, I'm so nervous. Bakers, you have five minutes left.
All right, lots of details. All right, guys, keep going. Got

213
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:34,500
time, I got time, I got time. I'm gonna get it out. For a run to
the blast chiller, to check on my water sea penicato.

214
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:46,440
Penicato. Yo, yo, we got this. Looks so yummy. One minute
left, Bakers, let's go. Okay, Kers. Focus, focus, focus.

215
00:29:46,440 --> 00:30:04,700
Almost there. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one, time's up. Oh. Good job, everyone. I would

216
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:15,320
need that. This is the best dessert I've plated yet. This is
Daughter Janiah. Bakers, we asked you to create a plated

217
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:23,540
chocolate dessert featuring an ingredient from our
international pantry. Tim, please bring us your dessert.

218
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:33,080
I've made a blue corn chocolate donut with a rose water and
raspberry coulis. I am astounded at the plate you presented

219
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:41,980
us. It's so clean and neat. And you chose a donut which, of
course, I get the slight joke, given you're a profession as a

220
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:55,600
policeman, but that is not like any donut. You're going to
find a donut store. Let's give it a try. Well, Tim, I thought

221
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:05,180
your donut's texture was so dreamy. It had that airiness and
lightness and was very chocolatey, but you could

222
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:14,220
definitely taste the blue corn. I so very much wish that you
would give me that recipe. That balance between the rich

223
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:23,520
chocolate and the perfume of the blue corn, it takes over
your palate, but in a good way, that postcard from your son

224
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:35,240
Clay gave you just that drive you needed. Thank you, Jedis.
Kristen, please bring us your plate. I made a waddle-sea

225
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:43,580
panna cotta and a chocolate hazelnut shortbread. Kristen,
you have really smartened up your plating style. Thank you.

226
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:57,020
It is composed and it looks like your panna cotta set okay.
Shall we give this a taste? Mm-hmm. Kristen, your dessert's

227
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:07,780
waddle-seed featured so beautifully. It was definitely
the start of that plate. Your shortbread tasted great. The

228
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:16,600
only thing I did not like your panna cotta, it was too tart. It
needed a little more sugar. But you have presented a

229
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:23,900
cohesive, well-rounded, plated dessert. Thank goodness
for this advantage and Chef Emma, because I would not have a

230
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:33,940
dessert to present. Mike, please bring us your dessert. I
present to you a matcha and a zucca roulade with milk

231
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:41,980
chocolate ganache, a zuccy bean jellies, and a tempered
chocolate garnish. This is a beautiful plate. Thank you.

232
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:47,580
I'm feeling nervous. No matter how confident I've been in
any of the desserts that I've given the judges, they have

233
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:57,160
faces that are very hard to read when they're eating your
dessert. Mike, Mikey, Michael. Now I'm in trouble. Yeah,

234
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:13,760
yeah. Mike, beautifully beautiful presentation. I love
how you cut the roulade on a bias to give it height. You should

235
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,860
be very proud of yourself. Thank you. I got the a zuccy bean
flavor, but I got that more than the chocolate. I lost the

236
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:27,920
chocolate in every aspect of the dessert. The milk
chocolate was a little mild against that earthy intensity

237
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:36,420
of a zuccy. But what I am very proud of, Mike, is your plate
presentation, your thought process, and the composition

238
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:47,920
of what you've presented to us. Thank you so much. Allie,
please bring it. I created a milk chocolate vertical sumac

239
00:33:47,920 --> 00:34:10,280
tart with a milk chocolate sumac ganache and a sumac caramel
sauce. Allie, absolutely gorgeous. Allie, your tart

240
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,719
shell, great crumb. It had a bite and a crunch and a flakiness
to it. That being said, you missed it on the caramel. You

241
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:25,840
didn't get that caramel there, and I couldn't taste the
sumac in it. If you have a tart that size and literally half a

242
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:34,460
teaspoon of caramel, you're not going to get that caramel in
every bite. Yeah. And I wanted more sumac. The real selling

243
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:44,480
feature of sumac is this sparkle of acidity. Yeah. So I
really wanted more of that. I am a little disappointed, but I

244
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:53,540
hope that my plating skills and presentation are enough to
keep me here. Ashley, please bring us your dessert. I made a

245
00:34:53,540 --> 00:35:01,840
tiger nut, a tiger nut brittle, and a maple tiger nut
crumble. What you've given us is a wonderfully beautiful

246
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:11,160
plate. The elements on the plate make sense, and this is a big
step up for you. Ashley, I want to congratulate you on that.

247
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:25,680
Thank you. Time for a taste. Ashley, your Nanaimo bar, the
custard layer and the chocolate layer were both beautiful.

248
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:33,380
I did run into slight issues with the brittle. A plated
dessert is meant so you could have crumbled your brittle a

249
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:41,260
little bit so that it can fit neatly on a fork. But the way you
integrated the tiger nut into that Nanaimo bar base

250
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:50,480
particularly gave it such texture and body and flavor at the
same time partnered with that intense chocolate, the

251
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:58,240
ganache on top. It was sublime. Thank you. So obviously
getting that postcard did something. It's lit a fire in you.

252
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:09,480
I can see that. I believe strongly. Your daughter is nothing
but proud of you. And we're super. Emma, please bring us your

253
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:20,400
dessert. I made a milk chocolate black sesame mochi filled
with black sesame milk chocolate ganache as well as a black

254
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:28,940
sesame chocolate salble. You are plating, I think it's
original and creative, and the mochi has got that clarity to

255
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:41,820
it. So you can see that dark intense sesame filling hiding
underneath. I can't wait to jump in. Emma, in giving us the

256
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:50,040
flavor of your black sesame paste, I think it was there. More
pronounced in the mochi than the salble. The chocolate

257
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:58,500
dominated the salble. So the two together in one bite were
equally balanced. But eating your mochi bowl, the filling

258
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:04,860
inside was a little bit too thick. So it was quite hard to
break into, and it's normally meant to be very smooth. And

259
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:13,480
your mochi itself too glutinous. It was really elastic. So I
think you need to refine your technique there. Thank you.

260
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:28,740
I'm really getting worried that I might be going home today.
Bakers, we asked for a plated chocolate dessert featuring

261
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:37,440
an ingredient from our global pantry. Some of you took us on
exciting voyages filled with irresistible flavors and

262
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:46,600
innovative plates. But sadly, not everyone's dessert had
the impact we were hoping for. When I call your name, please

263
00:37:46,600 --> 00:38:15,380
step forward. Mike. Mike. And... Both of you are safe. Tim
and Ashley, please step forward. The two of you had our

264
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:32,520
favorite desserts of this challenge. Thank you. But who had
the best dessert? Congratulations, Ashley. I'm so

265
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:40,720
excited. My daughter will be so proud of me. Ashley, your
tiger nut and enymo bar had ferocious flavor. We heard your

266
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:53,500
roar of determination in this challenge. Keep it up. Thank
you. Thank you. Emma and Ali, unfortunately, your desserts

267
00:38:53,500 --> 00:39:03,500
were not as successful. Ali, we have come to expect elegant
plates from you, which is exactly what you gave vertical

268
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:14,460
tart. It was striking. However, in a dessert where sumac was
meant to be showcased, it felt like an afterthought. Emma,

269
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:20,340
we thought your plating was charming, and you definitely
featured black sesame paste throughout your dessert.

270
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:30,440
Sadly, we found your mochi chewy and your sablée dry.
Unfortunately, one of you must leave this kitchen. The

271
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:52,540
baker who is going home is... Ali. Ali, you are an incredibly
talented baker with an artist's touch. You've shown us an

272
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:59,320
impressive array of techniques, and we know your baking is
going to become nothing short of exceptional. This whole

273
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:06,460
experience has been so incredible, and I'm so excited to be
able to share my message and my story to everyone out there.

274
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:12,680
Indigenous people need to be seen and heard, and I helped
take a little step forward for my own work. I love my people,

275
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:18,880
and I love that. Grateful for all of the knowledge I've
gotten. It's only going to help me become a better baker.

276
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:33,420
This is just the beginning. Wow. Next time on Great
Chocolate Showdown... Let's get ready to crumble! ...the
