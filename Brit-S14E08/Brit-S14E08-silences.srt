00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
[Silence]

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:15,760
It's party week today! Come on, Paul, let's do the conga. I am
buzzing. BOOING Tom was so excited when I said it was party

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:22,760
week. He's been hoping for this theme for years. Vote for the
Tom Allen party, Tom Allen for Prime Minister! Eventually,

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:33,580
vote for the Tom Allen party, everyone! Oh, that's sort of
party. I knew it was too good to be true. I'll vote for Tom.

5
00:00:33,580 --> 00:01:03,580
Thanks, Pistone. Prime Minister's vote! CHEERING
CHEERING Hello and welcome. It was party week in the tent.

6
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:20,140
Something never attempted before, and Prue knew there was
only one way to get through it. Nice nose. Prue! Come on. Come

7
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:29,640
on, let's go. Put the bottle. I know. I know. I'm so sorry.
Josh was every eight-year-old at a party after too much

8
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:43,440
sugar. Just down to kind of coke in about a minute. And it's
just time for the latest instalment of Who Knew with Prue.

9
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:56,520
Some trees are bisexual. They're male and female on the same
tree. And... And a reminder that you can watch the rest of

10
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:06,020
that episode on Channel 4 Catch Up. Tom will be back later to
inspect the party food. Who's helped with the catering?

11
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:18,000
CHEERING And, of course, we love having a peek at what you've
been baking in your kitchens at home. Like Anne from Lithams

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,960
and Anne's, who wanted to show off the cake she made for her
husband, Stephen's 70th birthday. Stephen's a keen tennis

13
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:36,120
player, and here's his cake. Clearly, Stephen has just
completed a particularly exhausting five-setter there.

14
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:42,020
But game-setting match to you, Anne. Brilliant. There'll
be more of those later, along with details of where to send

15
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:51,520
your pictures. Now, sadly, the party's over for one of the
bakers, Christie. Oh! During party week, Christie really

16
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:01,620
let her hair down and said something so shocking she
couldn't even believe it herself. I like sausage rolls. I

17
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:09,080
like sausage rolls as well, Christie. Something we can
discuss in a lot more detail when she's here later in the

18
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:19,600
show. To help us raise a toast to party week, I've invited a
fantastic panel of celebrity Bake Off fans. Present us,

19
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:33,360
Carla Moffitt, Camille Nabil Abou-Washid and Camille and
actress and writer, Ashring B. Now, Carla, just lovely to

20
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,640
have you with us. If you're hosting a party, what's on the
menu? Anything that's in the whoop-sile. Fucking going

21
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:47,740
there. Just anything, be it sausage rolls, Scotch eggs,
pork pies, paste pudding, breadsticks, sandwiches. Just

22
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:55,620
like, you know... That sounds like a snack. What about you,
Ashring? I like when someone tricks me. Like, there's a

23
00:03:55,620 --> 00:04:02,280
whole dinner but small. Like, at Yorkshire putting with a
whole dinner in it. You know, those little ones. Or like a

24
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,680
little sausage roll or like a thimble of magic mushrooms or
something. You know, just party quick. Buffet things that

25
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:16,420
you're nibbling on. Nabil, what food do you want to see on a
buffet table? I mean, I like things like Scotch eggs. Only

26
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:22,360
enough for a lot of these desserts. I grew up in Nigeria and
saw a lot of our desserts and a lot of our pastry-type stuff is

27
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,740
very Scottish. So, like, we like sausage rolls, Scotch
eggs. Very, very, very popular in Nigeria. Anything dipped

28
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:39,500
in lard? Yeah. Me too. That's the results. Ditto. OK, well,
let's remind ourselves what happened when Bake Off had a

29
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:50,760
bash. The quarterfinal. BEEPS And time to get the party
started. With Paul's all-time favourite. Sausage rolls.

30
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:58,240
Soy sauce, ginger, garlic. In the signature. Anything's a
louding pace, for sure. But not a sausage roll! Matty turned

31
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,700
up the heat. Nice bit of kick there from the chilli. A bit of
chilli flakes, yeah. And earned himself a handshake. Aw!

32
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:13,180
Thank you for bringing me a sausage roll. Caterpillar cakes
in the technical. Oh, yeah. What anything but child's play.

33
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:21,720
In the first spot, we have this one. Tasia. Beige was banned.
She didn't rise. In the colourful, all you can bake buffet

34
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,000
showstopper. Josh, I think you've done really well. It's
hard to fault anything. Sadly, the party was over for

35
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:35,980
Christy. It's a bit rough and ready. Oh, no. It tastes great.
And she left the tent. And Matty's sporty bake...

36
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:48,200
Cricketball pies. That's delicious. ...scored him his
second star baker. APPLAUSE So, the signature challenge

37
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:55,360
was to make Paul's all-time top treat, sausage rolls. Now,
Bill, you quite like a bit of cooking, don't you? But can you

38
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:02,420
make pastry? No, OK, here's the thing. Like I said,
culturally, we were told that cooking was OK for guys, but

39
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:10,520
only girls bake. Oh! Yeah, I know. So, currently, I'm
learning to bake from my daughters. Yeah, I'm trying to, you

40
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:20,160
know, reverse all the toxic masculinity, which is almost as
bad as gluten. LAUGHTER Well, this might surprise you, but I

41
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:30,720
can make the sausage roll. Just push it down a hill. Ay!
APPLAUSE What a lovely smatter of applause. Thank you so

42
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:39,400
much. On to Dan. Last week, he stunned the judges by serving
up Thai green curry creme caramel that sounded disgusting,

43
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:46,580
but tasted delicious. This week, it was dim sum-inspired
sausage rolls. Sadly, the judges didn't go for his

44
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,380
Chinese-inspired pork and prawn fillings. Well, I'll be
totally honest. I might sound thickier, but I didn't know

45
00:06:52,380 --> 00:07:00,160
you could put stuff other than sausages in sausage rolls. Do
you know what I mean? The poll would be like, You can't! Well,

46
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,340
yeah, because I just thought a sausage roll was just like a
big old sausage and some pastry. It is! I mean, what

47
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,260
qualifies a sausage roll if there's no sausage in it? Well,
it's the big thoughts here that we're dealing with. But,

48
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:20,340
like, yeah, sticking prawns in that in. Oh, I don't know how I
feel about that. I just think we need to stick to the basics. A

49
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:31,320
sausage roll should have some form of rolling. That was done
to a sausage of some kind. I mean, if we don't hold on to this, I

50
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:37,860
don't know where we're going as a society. But I loved that
something different was tried, that they threw a prawn into

51
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:44,000
a sausage roll thing. And also, the show demands it. Now they
expect, like, you know, glass-aid bombs inside of cakes

52
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,180
that can, you know, connect to at least 3G of internet. And
so, you can listen to the email on them. Like, the

53
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:55,540
expectations are high, so, you know, give it a good whirl,
I'd say. Paul made quite a claim. You can't beat a good

54
00:07:55,540 --> 00:08:03,640
sausage roll. I grew up with sausage rolls. I baked millions
and millions of sausage rolls in my time. I decided to work

55
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:12,880
out just how long it would take to bake millions and millions
of sausage rolls. Allowing for generous time to make the

56
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:20,380
pastry and filling, then bake them for 30 minutes in batches
of 12. Even if you only made one million and did nothing else

57
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:34,820
for eight hours a day, that's 45,000 days, which is over 124
years. Unfortunately, Tasha and Christie got distracted

58
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:51,480
from the task in hand when they discovered that they could
see each other through their ovens. LAUGHTER Ours are fun.

59
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,280
Now, Matty stayed classic with his sausage rolls. Pork,
onion, apple, oh, and one other ingredient. Where are the

60
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:12,660
chilli going? Up my arse, pru. Where's your... LAUGHTER In
the sausage meat, obviously. Matty triumphed in the

61
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:22,440
sausage roll signature because what did his flaky pastry
have, everyone? LAMINATION! Of course, lamination! Now,

62
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:34,220
here's the moment. Paul decided Matty was his man of the
match. Oh, nice crisp. Nice bit of kick there from the

63
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:43,640
chilli. Little bit of chilli flakes, yeah. Ah! Thank you for
bringing me sausage rolls. Very good sauce. It's

64
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:50,720
delicious. The onions really work, the apple really works.
The chilli is great in there. It's really good. Thank you,

65
00:09:50,720 --> 00:10:00,060
Matty. Congrats to Matty on his Hollywood handshake!
APPLAUSE I'm still thrown by the fact that everyone said

66
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:07,780
lamination and we just had to pretend like it was normal.
LAUGHTER Lamination! OK, I'll just go on with my life now.

67
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Scarlet, were you happy to see Matty get a handshake? Yeah,
like, his little eyes lit up and, like, yes, I know that, he

68
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:22,300
did a simple sausage roll, but, like, his bottom was hard,
his pastry was flaky. LAUGHTER He'd add lamination. He'd

69
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,800
add all the elements you need, didn't he? The tricky
technical challenge was to make an all-too-familiar

70
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:36,120
caterpillar cake, but that wasn't so familiar that Bake Off
got sued by a large supermarket chain. LAUGHTER Over to

71
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:44,760
Prue. So, Paul, the famous caterpillar cake. The trick
is... Not to infringe copyright. LAUGHTER The trick is

72
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:53,220
getting the bake right. Oh, OK, fair enough. Prue and Paul
were a bit ying and yang about the challenge. It's a terrific

73
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:01,260
challenge. It's a Swiss roll sponge. LAUGHTER I think the
caterpillar cake is a great way of going, I am friends with

74
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:07,920
you and I care about you and your birthday, but, like, within
office working hours. LAUGHTER It's obviously quite a

75
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:13,560
political cake because there are the lawsuits between
Colin and Cuthbert, but I have a bit of showbiz gossip that

76
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:24,140
after the lawsuits, they got together. And they had a little
larvae cupcake. LAUGHTER It was just a little cake.

77
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:31,940
LAUGHTER Now, the instructions demanded that the baker's
cup bits out of their Swiss roll sponge to achieve the

78
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:40,080
required shape. Then it was time for the bakers to give their
caterpillar cakes a face full of childish appeal. Enjoy

79
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,560
yourselves, kiddy winks. The decorations is where they can
have a little bit of their artistic flair. All kids love that

80
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:53,820
at the birthday party. I am going to do the face. I'm going to
let it set and then put its little features on. Rosie Cheeks

81
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,260
may look quite nice. This will be the best bit of the whole
cake, I think. It's supposed to be a little cuter. It's a bit

82
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:17,360
weird. It's not quite the children's party I was hoping for.
WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS

83
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:31,500
WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS
LAUGHTER This is wow! Joe! You're acting. Go to the

84
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:38,300
Lattricks. After award-winning. Wow. I think my favourite
there was Matties, because nothing says fun children's

85
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:46,220
party cake like a caterpillar that's had its mouth stitched
up. LAUGHTER It looked like a new character in Thomas the

86
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:54,540
Tank engine. Thomas the cheery one, Gordon the boasty one
and Simon the serial killer. LAUGHTER Did any of those

87
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:11,080
appeal to you? The faces on them. No. No. OK. Time now to ask
the big question. What's that? That was, in fact, the dough

88
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:19,360
for Tasha's bread milk pigs. Of course it was. They formed
part of her ambitious farmyard themed buffet. There were so

89
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:27,020
many elements to her showstopper that Mattie was wondering
just how long Tasha would be stood there listing them. I've

90
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:34,840
made milk bread, pigs and blackberry creme de creme that
show and pistachio and raspberry flavoured Viennese rolls

91
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:45,740
with a raspberry and peach jam. LAUGHTER In happier news for
the second time this series, Mattie was awarded star baker.

92
00:13:45,740 --> 00:14:02,100
Congratulations to Mattie! Yay! Mattie was pulling out all
the stops with his sporting themed buffet showstopper.

93
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:10,640
We've got a cricket ball curry pie, a orange cupcake golf
course and some creme brulee donut basketballs. Until now,

94
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:17,840
the question, what's that spongy orange lump doing on a golf
course has only been asked when Donald Trump's playing 18

95
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:29,700
holes at Mar-a-Dame. APPLAUSE Josh's impressive
showstopper made the battle for star baker a close race. Was

96
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,320
Mattie the right choice? I mean, I'm not going to take it away
from him because he did amazing, but that Christmas

97
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:43,180
showstopper... Sounds like you're taking it away from him
there, Ed. I'm sorry! But those little snowmen macaroons,

98
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:50,240
like, I would pay for them. And let's have an extra burst of
celebration to mark the fact that thanks to Mattie, we saw

99
00:14:50,240 --> 00:15:05,480
the first appearance in the tent this series of a deep fat
fryer. APPLAUSE Thanks, guys. And after the break, Tom

100
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:12,820
Allen will be here with his big paper plate to sample the
buffet provided by our audience bakers. Back in a bit.

101
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:31,120
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Welcome back. I'm here with Bake Off Fan
Scarlet Moffat, Nabil Abdul Rashid and Ashing Bee. Time now

102
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:44,900
for the party to really get started. It's Tom's tent talk!
APPLAUSE APPLAUSE Oh, hi, everyone. Hi. Hi. Sorry, we've

103
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:51,620
been having such a party backstage. Hi. Hi. How are you
doing? Oh, the party's in full swing back there. Do you want

104
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:58,000
any of these? Oh, don't worry about this. Oh, yes, we've had
all your normal party foods, yes. You know, the classics,

105
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:09,140
brulee doughnuts, courant reeds, bread, pigs. Yes, this
week it was party week. I enjoyed the no beige theme. It meant

106
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:17,320
we got to see so many colours like Christie's marvellous
sweet factory. Oh, no, that one's beige. Maybe there's

107
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:25,780
another one. How about Josh's courant? Oh, no, that was
beige as well. OK. How about Tasha's creme diplomat sheep?

108
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:32,560
Oh, OK, also beige. Gosh, baking things in the oven really
puts the beige back in, doesn't it? Oh, well, never mind.

109
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,160
I'll be honest. I don't know if this is a party I really want to
go to. It's all got a bit less friendly in the tent lately.

110
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,640
Remember when they used to all hold hands at the end? Now look
at them. Have they all fallen out? Is it getting too

111
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,160
competitive? Or is it the fact that guys have outnumbered
the girls now? And they're all a bit too macho for that.

112
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:59,280
Mattie's even sitting like he's in a football team photo.
And speaking of lads, lads, lads, down by the scene on his

113
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:08,680
baking secrets. So what I'll do is look at my children, copy
what someone else is doing. Ha-ha-ha! Ah! Ha-ha-ha! It

114
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:15,280
turns out that Dan is just a copycat and feels nothing but
disdain towards his fellow man. So after all that, it turns

115
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:22,780
out Dan... I actually quite like you. But that's the new
macho tent, isn't it? Just full of men who struggle to show

116
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:33,480
affection for each other. Look at the way Paul talks about
the bakers. Well, let's have a look at these pigs. Well, I

117
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:39,480
suppose that must mean he loves them. Anyway, I'd better get
back to this party. Someone's got the karaoke machine out

118
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:45,440
and the neighbours have called the police. Turn it down,
Prue, for goodness sake. Anyway, see you next week. Prue,

119
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:56,220
get that community support officer out of a headlock. I've
told you! Thanks, Tom. Right, let's take a look at some of the

120
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:07,400
pictures you've been sending in of the baking you've been
doing at home. Emma Inhove wanted to celebrate her daughter

121
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,680
Frieda's 10th birthday in style. Not the easiest
challenge, given that Frieda had requested a

122
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:25,200
ferret-themed party. But Emma gave it her best shot and
here's Frieda's cake. Oh, God. Emma also arranged for a real

123
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:33,960
ferret to put in an appearance, and here's the moment the two
ferrets met. Oh, my God. That is a horror picture. All of

124
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:42,840
that. Even the ferrets, like, what the hell is that? When it
comes to creating a birthday cake for her granddaughter

125
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:52,180
Matilda, Deborah in Somerset's not one to chicken out. Oh,
wow. That is great, isn't it? It's a chocolate cake with

126
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:59,320
individually handmade fondant feathers. Meanwhile, in
Middlesex, Natalie was hard at work creating a cake for the

127
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,840
family dog Hazel's second birthday. Aw. Just look at that
intelligent little face. Let's find out how successfully

128
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:21,160
Natalie captured Hazel in cake form. Those delicate
features of sportour, aren't they? Happy birthday, Hazel.

129
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:28,480
And finally to Kersti in Kent, who's an A-level sociology
student. She decided to put her baking skills to the test

130
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:38,240
with a recreation of none other than German philosopher
Karl Marx. But somewhere along the line, Karl Marx seems to

131
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:59,520
have morphed into Paul Hollywood. Nevertheless, dust is
capital, Kersti. Well done. Thank you for Tom to

132
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:07,500
interrogate our studio audience on the bake they brought
along. Don't let her worry. Over to you, Tom. Thanks, Joe.

133
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:14,260
Well, first up, I've got Nicky. Where's Nicky? Oh, Nicky,
right here. Hello. Hello, Nicky. Hello. Who are you here

134
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:22,420
with? James. Hi. You look familiar. Do I? Are you me? Yes, I
think you are. Nicky, how do you know this man? We work

135
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:28,420
together. Where do you work? At an auction house. Well, it
must be a posh one. You seem very posh. No, thank you. So you

136
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:32,820
work together at an auction house. I do. What do you do in the
auction house? I'm behind the scenes. Marketing.

137
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,460
Marketing, that sort of thing. And what do you do, James? I
mean, I sell oil paintings, watercolours, prints. OK,

138
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:42,800
you're an auctioneer? Yeah, I'm an auctioneer. Have you
been on Flog It? No, I haven't, but I know most of the people

139
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:55,940
who have. Well, why haven't you been on it, James? I've got
pride. You do seem a lot like me, James. OK, well, Nicky and

140
00:20:55,940 --> 00:21:01,700
James, what have you brought along here? So that's meant to
be yourself. So you're auctioning off the missing

141
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:08,140
raspberry. That's a raspberry, is it? That is, yes. The
raspberry that's bigger than my head. Yes, that's great. I

142
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:16,140
see, I see. Lovely, lovely. You've got Noel, Alison, Paul
and Pro. Oh, wonderful. Gosh, yes, what lovely hair they all

143
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:23,260
have. No, Joe Brown, though. No, Joe Brown. Yeah, I didn't
have time. Oh, that's charming, isn't it? Oh, what I will say

144
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:28,160
is, are all the Bake Off people, are they in some sort of
quicksand while they're bidding? They're simply

145
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,400
disappearing into it. They're in a snowstorm, but they
still kept bidding on that raspberry. Lovely, lovely. Your

146
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,880
mum was meant to come. Your mum was meant to come. Yeah, she's
ill. She's ill? Oh, no. Is she OK? What's wrong with her? She

147
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:46,800
made you. She made me. Yes. Like my own mother. And... Well
done, Nicky, well done, James. Lovely to see you and lovely

148
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:58,080
to know what I'd look like wearing glasses. Thank you very
much. Now, I've got Chloe with Chloe. Hello, Chloe. Chloe.

149
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,260
Chloe, hi, Chloe. Who are you here with today? I'm with my
husband Bradley. Husband Bradley. I'm with my friend

150
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:09,160
Gemma. Gemma, hi. Now, Chloe, what have you done here? We've
made a chocolate cake in the shape of a yurt. Oh, a yurt? A

151
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:14,040
yurt. Which is like a fancy tent, isn't it? Yeah, it is. When
you go glamping. When you go glamping. That's glamorous

152
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:21,360
camping, isn't it? It is. Yes, that's something that people
describe me as, actually. LAUGHTER And it's got avocado

153
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:30,940
chocolate ganache. Really? Avocado? Why avocado? Because
we're vegan. Oh, I knew you'd let us know eventually.

154
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:40,140
LAUGHTER Oh, vegans can't keep it hidden, can they? No,
people know. You're vegan. You're vegan. Come in here.

155
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:45,400
You're vegan cake and you're both vegan. Yes. Lovely to be
you, vegan. I'm vegetarian. Vegetarian milkless cows.

156
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:54,280
Woo! LAUGHTER So, why is this important to you, the yurt and
everything? We love going glamping and on holiday. We go

157
00:22:54,280 --> 00:23:01,800
with our friends. What do you like about glamping so much?
It's more adventurous than a hotel, isn't it? Well, is it?

158
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,680
It's a tent that has a bed in it. And you have to wear wellies to
go to the toilet. That's exciting. Which you don't have to

159
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:13,960
do. You don't know the hotels I stay in. And so you like the
fact you have to wear wellies to go to the toilet. OK, and do

160
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,340
you like going to these places as well? I quite enjoy it. You
quite enjoy it. And that's what you do for a holiday. You just

161
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:27,360
quite enjoy it? Yeah. Bradley, what do you do for a living? I
work in tech support. And... OK, thanks, Chloe. Give it up

162
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:38,660
for Chloe and Anne, Bradley and Gemma. OK, where's Crystal?
Crystal, Crystal. Over here. Crystal. Crystal. Hello. And

163
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:46,960
Emma. Emma and... Becky. Becky. We co-founded a group
called Mothers Rise Up. Mothers Rise Up, what's that all

164
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,420
about? It's about bread? No, we're mums, and we're rising up
for climate action. Oh, that's very impressive. Mums

165
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:03,840
rising up for climate action. One person clap. And so... Oh,
four people clap. More people clap! And so we decided to take

166
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:10,600
two, bring along, like, good clean energy to your party. So,
like this, and shredded wheat. There's a solar panel there.

167
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,920
There's a solar panel. Lovely. And they're powering a huge
lightbulb. And you came on public transport? I walked. You

168
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:24,980
walked? From where? I set off about three days ago. You
said... No, you didn't. Very important message. How did you

169
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:32,800
get here? I actually came by car. You came by car. Was it an
electric car? No. OK, anyway, so... No, no, no, no, no, no,

170
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,380
no, no, no, no, no, no. Our message is that you don't have to be
pure to make statement about climate. I think that's very

171
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:42,920
important. A very important way to address it as well, I
appreciate it. So, well done, all of you. Thank you so much

172
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:48,780
for coming along today. Thank you. Which ever mode of
transport you used. How did you get here? Private jet. Tube.

173
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:54,320
All right, thanks. OK, well done. Crystal and friends,
thank you. Thank you very much. Lovely. OK, now I've got

174
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:06,080
Miles and Gary. Miles and Miles and Gary. Miles and Gary.
Gays. Yes. Gays! Gay Bakers, everyone. Always a winner. And

175
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:12,020
you two are together. Yes, we are. Yes, we are married. You
are married. Very good. OK, great. Sorry, no claps, we're

176
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:18,140
not American. Miles, where are you from? Originally from
Buckinghamshire. You're from Buckinghamshire. But we

177
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:26,280
live in Newcastle. Oh, you live in Newcastle? Yeah! How did
you meet? We met on a course when we were training to be head

178
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:31,820
teachers. You're head teachers? You were. You were head
teachers. Why did you stop being head teachers? Were you

179
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:38,180
sacked? No. No. We decided we wanted to do something
different, so we set up our own business. Oh, what does that

180
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:44,000
do? We work with schools, helping them to improve, and we do
big, choral events with lots of children. Oh, wow! In the

181
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,400
North East. Do you sing? We sing in a couple of choirs, do you?
Do you? Do you? I conduct a choir. You conduct a choir? Yes.

182
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:56,800
And this space? Oh, yes, the cake. Sorry, I was coming onto
the cake, Miles. Sorry, I'm not in assembly at the moment.

183
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:02,880
Yes, we can talk about the cake you made here. Now, what is it,
Miles? It's a fully inclusive choir. I was going to say

184
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:10,800
inclusive of what? Because there seem to be some
interesting characters. Different skin tones of shoe bun.

185
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:18,420
That's very important. Yes, representation. A rainbow. A
rainbow. It's a lot of bottles of champagne, so there's

186
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:26,140
drunks as well. And it's based a little bit on... We have a big
bauble party every year. Gary, what are you talking about?

187
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:33,080
So, Gary goes mad at Christmas. I go mad at Christmas and I
love Christmas trees. And so, people come round from miles

188
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:38,640
around to see your baubles? Absolutely. You can't put them
on the tree. We have lots of trees. Oh, you're those sorts of

189
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:50,780
gays. How many trees do you have? Eleven. Eleven Christmas
trees. Of different sizes. Sure, no-one likes a size queen.

190
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:58,400
No. Gary does it all. Gary does all the... I do it all. You're
not allowed near it, Miles. No, he isn't. I've never hung a

191
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:07,640
single bauble. Really? That surprises me about you. Well,
I'll take these up to the panel. I'm sure they'll enjoy them

192
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:13,800
very much. OK, welcome, everyone. Give it up for Gary and
Miles. Gary and Miles, thank you. Thank you. Oh, you are

193
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:25,240
welcome. Thank you. Wow. And I'm delighted to announce that
this week's star baker is... Chrisso, Emma and Becky.

194
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:34,260
Wonderful. Wonderful. Very important. Talk about climate
change today. Beautiful. But now I have to look sad whilst

195
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:41,600
carrying out the secretly enjoyable task of announcing who
will be asked to leave the studio this week. And I'm

196
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:58,960
afraid... It's going to be... Nicky and James, because
James is so snooty about flogging. Don't write that. Don't

197
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,240
write that sort of behaviour here. It's going to be James.
Great cake, though. Great cake. I hope those people get out

198
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:18,360
of that quicksand. But the good news is they each leave with a
party bag containing an extra slice of wooden spoon. And a

199
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:29,560
huge thank you to all of our studio bakers. APPLAUSE Great.
Thanks very much, Tom. Coming up after the break, star of the

200
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:48,560
party, Christy will be here. Back shortly. APPLAUSE
Welcome back. I'm here with party animals Scarlett,

201
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:54,940
Neville and Ashling. And it's time to meet the woman of the
hour. Will you please give it up for Bake Off Quarter

202
00:28:54,940 --> 00:29:09,700
Finalist? Christy! APPLAUSE Welcome, Christy. Fantastic
to have you here. Thank you. First of all, massive

203
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:15,920
congratulations for making it all the way through to the
quarter final. It's a brilliant achievement, isn't it?

204
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:22,260
Yeah. It's such a good achievement for me. Having the four
kids and stuff. It's the first sort of thing I've done for

205
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:30,900
myself. And, yeah... Did they watch the show almost like a
football match? Like, I'm like, come on, Mum! Mum, can you

206
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:39,620
get me a snack? Well, you seem like a very close bunch this
year, but you bonded with one person in particular, and

207
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:54,260
you've actually brought him along tonight. Where are you?
Amos. Hello. APPLAUSE Did you two meet before the tent? Yes,

208
00:29:54,260 --> 00:30:03,760
we actually met in auditions. Oh, really? It was love at
first sight. It was. When we went for the first episode, I got

209
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:12,060
out the car and, literally, Amos had just got out of his car,
and we were, like, screaming. I don't know. I'm so excited.

210
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:18,960
And we walked in together. Yeah, it was just a pleasure. It's
so nice. Have a sort of pre-friend, isn't it? Are you proud of

211
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:27,940
Christy making it so far? I am so proud of you, seriously. Oh.
But, like in the audition, I saw her cake in the audition, and

212
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:36,660
I was shaking in my boots, seriously, guys. Was it that bad?
No. It was that good. Thank you for coming along, Amos. It's

213
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:47,270
lovely to see you again. It really is. Thank you. Yeah!
APPLAUSE So, Christy, when people recognise you out and

214
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:54,240
about, what sort of thing do they say to you? Do you know what?
It's always the same, and it's always, Is Alison as lovely?

215
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:03,400
She seems on the TV in real life. Have you told everyone she's
a real cow? LAUGHTER I'm your puss, too, cos we all know she's

216
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:09,640
lovely. I'm just like, no, she's even lovely, and,
honestly, she is. She's so warm. Yeah, she's very natural,

217
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:17,060
isn't she? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Now, it also turns out
that you and the makers are always talking about no. Watch

218
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:26,800
this. You do have great skin, though, I must say. We always
talk about it. He does. I think the reason I said that is

219
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:36,560
because that was the week we all found out he turned 50. No
way! What? He's 50? Wait, or 40? No, he's 50, yeah. No, he's

220
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:49,020
50. So, how did you get on with Paul and Prue? Yeah, when I
first met Paul... LAUGHTER That wasn't his! Yeah, Paul

221
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:57,340
scared me more than Prue. Prue seemed more soft. Yeah, she's
lovely. Paul's lovely, too. I think as the weeks go by and you

222
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:03,230
get to know them, you just feel much more relaxed and at ease,
and you're sort of talking to them outside of judging. But

223
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:10,800
during judging, Paul's pretty brutal. Yeah, I think he
likes to think that he's intimidating, doesn't he? Yeah, he

224
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:16,640
definitely plays on it, yeah. But because I must say, I'm
really enjoying watching you and Paul on your spin-off

225
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:31,980
show, Alien Autopsy. MUSIC PLAYS That was the dreaded
eight-plated bread, of course. Yeah. Panna, would you

226
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:39,140
watch a crime drama with Paul as the maverick cop and... He'd
be called something like the needy detective. I'd like him

227
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:47,100
to be called the Killsbury Doughboy. LAUGHTER And then you
could have Alison as the death sardine. There's been a

228
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:57,580
murder! Ha-ha! LAUGHTER Right. Well, let's revisit some of
your incredible creations, because they were. Now, in

229
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,880
Botanical's week, the judges couldn't resist your maple
and pecan spice buns, and you won the lemon and thyme drizzle

230
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,360
cake technical. And then you seem to really enjoy the whole
experience of making your floral dessert showstopper.

231
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,260
Well, you might not be... Let's just have a look at that and
listen to what your thoughts were on that challenge. Oh,

232
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:28,200
thank God it's over. LAUGHTER Yeah. Yeah, you did your fail,
like, yeah, absolutely. You kicked off pastry week by

233
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:34,060
getting a Hollywood handshake for your creamy,
leek-and-mushroom picnic pies and dazzled the judges with

234
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:45,140
your autumnal lattice pies, which earned you star baker.
Yeah. How was that? APPLAUSE It was amazing. I didn't expect

235
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:51,780
it. You know, you're very modest. You don't want to get your
hopes up. Of course, Josh was amazing, and in my mind, it was

236
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:58,580
100% going to him. So when they say your name, it was just
like, yeah, it's such a nice experience, really lovely. And

237
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:05,740
some of your most memorable bakes included your chocolate
week showstopper, which looked exquisite. And, of course,

238
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:12,040
your incredible cake week showstopper. In the guise of a
duck, look at that, everyone. That is the main thing. I think

239
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:23,440
it's a duck. A real duck. APPLAUSE Here's a bit of that unseen
footage from Bread Week, which made me laugh. I don't really

240
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:37,199
know how it's gone. How has it gone? OK. Yeah, it's gone quite
well. LAUGHTER That's it. They just do it as I'm told.

241
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:47,239
Absolutely. That's so sweet, though. So, for now,
everybody, thank you so much. Christy. CHEERING AND

242
00:34:47,239 --> 00:35:01,980
APPLAUSE So, what does every good party week need? Music.
Well said. That's brilliant. LAUGHTER Very well done. And,

243
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:22,420
supplying tonight's dance floor fillers, will you please
welcome Woohoo! It's the Mary Arches, everyone. APPLAUSE

244
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:33,800
Now, the Mary Arches are going to put their spin on some
classic party songs. You lot shout out when you think you

245
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:44,340
know what they're playing. OK, is that makes sense? Yes!
Right, so, Mary Arches, are you ready? Yeah! All right, take

246
00:35:44,340 --> 00:36:03,700

BLOWS Whitney Houston, all the way! CHEERING That's the

247
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:29,080
best thing you've got at night, everyone. Let's see. MUSIC
PLAYS CHEERING APPLAUSE OK, are you ready for your next one?

248
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:50,920
Yeah. Take it away. MUSIC PLAYS WHISTLE BLOWS WHISTLE BLOWS
Any out there? Anyone? Is it upside your head? LAUGHTER I

249
00:36:50,920 --> 00:37:17,920
really wish it was, but no, it's not. All right, let's find
out. Off you go, then. MUSIC PLAYS APPLAUSE That was very

250
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:32,640
powerful. OK, this is the last one. Oh, my God. So, listen
really carefully. What do you think this is? MUSIC PLAYS Oh,

251
00:37:32,640 --> 00:38:01,360

PLAYS OK, come on, I need by Texas Midnight Riders. And thank
you very much. Give it up for the Mary Archies, then.

253
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:23,780
CHEERING APPLAUSE Now, Christy, I believe that you can
complete a Rubik's Cube in under four minutes. I can. But

254
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:31,760
sadly, we haven't got the time for that. LAUGHTER But stay
with us, cos Tom is on his way with a special gift for you. See

255
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:51,820
you in a bit, guys. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Welcome back.
We're all here. Scarlett, Nabil, Ashling and Christy. OK,

256
00:38:51,820 --> 00:39:02,840
who fancies a game of Artie Party? APPLAUSE So, Scarlett,
right, you've got a card with some party words and phrases on

257
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:10,680
it, and all you need to do is draw them, and the rest of the
panel and Christy will... Guess what they are. You can't use

258
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:24,260
any letters or symbols, OK? But I can draw the item. Yeah. All
right, Scarlett, your time starts now. A balloon. Yeah!

259
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:31,720
Well done. So that's number one. Well done for wiping your
own board. Beautiful artist, Scarlett, I have to say. I

260
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:42,380
really saw that balloon. I've got an A star at Textiles. Get
on with it. Um... Number two, yeah. Not A number two, but... A

261
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:52,100
hole. Down a hole. Stone skimming. Are you doing the same one
as I've done? Yeah! Is that a T-cup, am I...? Er... Falling

262
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:59,560
out of a hole. Frisbees. Falling out of... Tumbling out of a
hole. Air hole. Definitely hole, I cut. All right,

263
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:09,340
Scarlett, what is it? The sausage roll. LAUGHTER It's a
sausage roll. Why did you nod at me every time I said a hole?

264
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:30,980
Cos it grabs the roll. I genuinely thought you were doing the
wrong one. And your next one. Moose Christmas reindeer.

265
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:44,010
Roondi. Opposite of him. Moose hunter. Spectacled. Yeah!
APPLAUSE And your final one, number ten. One second. The

266
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:56,460
Tate Britain. Scarlett Moffat exhibition. I'm not a part of
the big... Yes, Will Taken! Yay! This right, erm... Vape.

267
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:09,520
Vaping. Er... Er... Er... Foghorn. Party poppers. Yay!
APPLAUSE Scarlett, you've done a party popper. I think

268
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,240
you've got it slightly wrong. Look at the card again. Party
pooper. Lots of party poppers you've had! I'm glad you

269
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:31,980
didn't have to draw that. Hi! Yes, that's absolutely well
done. APPLAUSE OK, Christy, we're going to ask the panel now

270
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:39,300
to tell us what they loved about watching you on Bake Off
Scarlett. Everything. And I really hope that you take some

271
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:45,800
self-confidence from this because watching you, like, I
just feel like sometimes you're so hard on yourself, but you

272
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:52,300
made it to the quarterfinals, like, you're amazing, so I
hope that you take that with you. And yeah, you're just

273
00:41:52,300 --> 00:42:03,280
wonderful. Aw, thank you. Yeah, yeah. APPLAUSE Vaping. As
someone who is naturally very anxious, like, I always doubt

274
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,980
myself. I enjoyed watching someone like me overcome that.
You were fantastic, and I'm sure you make a lot of people

275
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:21,140
happy that you don't even know about. APPLAUSE That's
great. Not for me, sorry. LAUGHTER You know what I loved? I

276
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,740
loved that you openly said, like, you hadn't done anything
for yourself. And I think so many people who you do get

277
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:31,640
motherhood and be a joy and stuff, but that it's not your only
purpose and that to do something for yourself is so

278
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,040
important. And to come out of those years going, actually, I
have a little ambition for myself and it becomes a big one and

279
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:46,740
here you are. So I think that's usually important. Thank
you. APPLAUSE I'm excited. OK, thanks very much, everyone.

280
00:42:46,740 --> 00:43:00,900
And now here comes Tom and his trolley. APPLAUSE Oh, my,
Gryffie. Will you tell us what you're going to take away from

281
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:09,680
your time on Bake Off? Just to believe in myself more and just
all my lovely baking family. Oh, well, that's another thing

282
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:18,020
to say. And here's what I think. LAUGHTER Christy, you are
one hell of a baker. I understand your need for perfection,

283
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:27,360
of course. I'm just the same. Look at my hair. Christy, you
make candy canes out of cheese straws in a tent. And not many

284
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:35,080
people can say that, perhaps for obvious reasons. You were
brilliant on this year's Bake Off and you should be so proud

285
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:46,120
of yourself. Just don't you forget it. We're all very, very
proud of you here. So remember that. Thank you. APPLAUSE

286
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:53,820
Thanks, Tom. And now, Christy, let's all enjoy a look back at
your time in the tent. I'm trying to just take a look and enjoy

287
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:00,440
it. I think it looks really appetising. Christy, you need my
bestie, though. Wow. They look impressive inside. I'll

288
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:09,200
tell you that now. You have. Beautifully moist inside and
crispy. So what I will do... Thank you. Just my instinct,

289
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:16,800
yeah. The winner is this one, Christy. Perfect. Oh, my gosh.
I think you need to do it again. Shanaf. You're lovely. Oh,

290
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,840
that's gorgeous, yeah. It looks wonderful. It's perfect,
isn't it? They're beautiful. I've never had French Pan with

291
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:29,960
Basby in it before. That's amazing. I love that. This week's
star baker is Christy. It's been like a life journey. You

292
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,340
know, I've done really well. I love that. Tastes great. Star
baker, handshake. Can these things mean the world to me? Go,

293
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:58,400
go! I'm so proud of myself. APPLAUSE So, Tom, if you could
reveal all... APPLAUSE So, Christy, they are with your

294
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,640
willing lemon and thyme drizzle cake, beautiful chocolate
box, and Mr Holly was favourite picnic pies. Christy,

295
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:18,620
everybody. CHEERING So, that's it for this week. A big thank
you to Tom, to Christy, to the Mary Archies, all our studio

296
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:27,160
bakers, and to our celebrity panel, Scarlett Moffat, Nabil
Abdul Rashid, and Ashling B, see you same time next week for

297
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:35,260
the Bake Off Semi-Final. Goodbye. Are you a star baker in the
making? If you'd like to apply for the next series of Bake

298
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:48,480
Off, visit Channel4.com or would slash take part.
Qualifications in the bag, but England still need a point to

299
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,340
make sure of topping the group. Full coverage as Malta come
to Wembley live from 7 o'clock tomorrow, which means that

300
00:45:54,340 --> 00:46:00,180
GoverBox will be on a bit later than usual at 10 o'clock.
We're next tonight, Taskmasters keeping up with the times,

301
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:09,040
with Alex's very own VAR system. Although the fact he's
called it the Dream Crusher doesn't bode well, I reckon.
